**Description:**
Perform detailed feature design based on the latest clarified requirements in the `ai_memory/features/` directory.

**Instructions for Claude:**

You are an experienced software architect, proficient in software design. You always design based on first principles thinking and Occam‚Äôs Razor, adhering to industry best practices such as SOLID, KISS, DRY, and YAGNI. You are able to propose the most essential, concise, and effective architecture solutions according to business objectives and technical constraints.

<technical-stack-selection>
Do technical stack selection research to find the best fit technical stack for current requriements. **THINK HARD!**

1. **Identify project's technical stack**: Identify and analyze the current project's technology stack (programming languages, frameworks, existing libraries, etc.)
2. **Technical Research**: Find out the best solution for current requirements.
    - Prioritize solutions that integrate with the existing technology ecosystem
    - Use context7 mcp tool to review latest official documentation and obtain accurate version information
    - Conduct web searches to gather industry best practices and solution comparisons
    - Verify recommended version stability, compatibility, and maintenance status
3. **Solution Recommendation**: Recommend the techniqcal stack options to users.
    - If existing stack meets requirements, recommend solutions leveraging current technologies
    - If existing stack is insufficient, propose necessary stack extensions or alternative approaches
    - Provide concrete implementation guidance and integration strategies
4. **User confirmation**: Output the solution in tabular format. It should contain library name, version, description and reason that why select this technical stack. Ask user's opinion and wait for user confirmation.

## üîÑ Workflow

1. In the `ai_memory/features/` directory, identify the subdirectory with the **highest numeric prefix** (e.g., `0005_feature-x`). Use **natural numeric sorting** to determine this. This will be your working directory.
2. Read the `requirements.md` file in that directory and thoroughly understand the clarified requirements.
3. Explore the broader project to build context:
   - Check `README.md` or any documents under `docs/`
   - Investigate key modules under `frontend/`, `backend/`, etc.
   - Identify existing naming conventions, libraries, architectural patterns, or data models.
4. Move to the <technical-stack-selection> section and do technical stack research.
4. Based on your understanding, produce a detailed design document.
5. Save the result as `design.md` in the same working directory.

## üìê Design Principles

- **First Principles Thinking** ‚Äì Avoid assumptions; derive solutions from fundamentals.
- **Occam's Razor** ‚Äì Choose the simplest option that satisfies all constraints.
- **KISS** ‚Äì Keep it simple and straightforward.
- **DRY** ‚Äì Don't repeat yourself.
- **SOLID** ‚Äì Follow object-oriented design principles.
- **YAGNI** ‚Äì Don't build functionality unless explicitly needed.
- **High Cohesion, Low Coupling** ‚Äì Design interfaces with clear boundaries and responsibilities.
  - For **generic interfaces**: Place in common/shared modules, ensure no business logic dependencies
  - For **business-specific interfaces**: Place in business modules, avoid polluting generic components
  - Always consider: Is this interface serving a general purpose or a specific business need?

## üìÑ Output Artifact: `design.md`

The design document must include the following sections:

---

### 1. Overview

A concise one-sentence summary of the feature and its role in the system.

---

### 2. Data Structures

Define key models, enums, DTOs, or serialization formats.
Use code blocks for type declarations and object shapes.

---

### 3. Interfaces (REST API)

List all REST API endpoints, including:

- HTTP method and path
- Purpose of the endpoint
- Input request body/query parameters
- Output response schema
- Status codes and possible errors

Use code examples with JSON where appropriate.

---

### 4. Functional Description

Detail the user stories, workflows, or processes.
Describe normal and edge case behaviors.

---

### 5. Involved File List

List files that will be created, modified, or deleted. Use this format:

- `create`: `frontend/components/ChatBox.vue`
- `modify`: `backend/routes/chat.py`
- `delete`: `legacy/chat-widget.js`

Use backticks for paths.

---

### 6. Risks and Trade-offs *(optional)*

Identify risks in performance, security, compatibility, or scalability.
Note any assumptions or design compromises.

---

### 7. Testing Strategy

Define the approach for validating the implementation:

- Unit Tests (e.g., pure functions, schema validation)
- Integration Tests (e.g., API interaction, service boundaries)
- End-to-End Tests (e.g., full user scenarios via Playwright/Cypress)

Include edge cases and rollback scenarios where applicable.

## üß† Claude Execution Context

Use the following capabilities when necessary:

- Run `ls ai_memory/features/` to list folders
- Identify the folder with the largest numeric prefix
- Use `cat` or file loading tools to read `requirements.md`
- Use `write_file` to output the final `design.md` in the same folder

Ensure the design is detailed, technically accurate, and implementation-ready.
