<read-design-doc>
Follow these steps to locate the feature desgin document:
1. Navigate to the `ai_memory/features/` directory.
2. Identify the subdirectory with the highest numeric prefix (e.g., `0005_feature-name`).
3. Read the `design.md` file located in this directory.
</read-design-doc>

<research>
Research current project to understand the coding context, including project structure, coding convention, naming convention, architecture, framework and library integration. Follow these research steps:
1. **Read project documents**: Navigate to the `ai_memory/project/` directory and read project documents.
2. **Initial Reconnaissance**:
    - Examine the current file's directory location and purpose
    - Review sibling files to understand module relationships
    - Check parent directory structure for architectural patterns
    - Identify relevant configuration files and project metadata
3. **Architectural Pattern Recognition**: Analyze existing code samples to determine:
    - Consistent formatting and style patterns
    - Naming conventions across different code elements
    - Import/dependency management patterns
    - Comment and documentation styles
    - Error handling approaches
</research>

<plan>
Break down coding tasks and make a plan:
1. Break down the implementation into a checklist of discrete, clear, and actionable coding tasks.
2. Each checklist item should describe a concrete development task, e.g., "Implement REST API endpoint `/user/login` in `backend/routes/user.py`."
3. Output this checklist as a Markdown file named `plan.md` in the same directory.
</plan>

<execution>
1. Proceed to implement the tasks one by one following the checklist.
2. After completing each task, update `plan.md` to mark the task as done.
3. Commit or save the code after each completed task.
</execution>

<format>
Run the following shell command to format only the Python files that were modified or added in this session. This ensures that the code adheres to the project's style standards before completion.

<command>
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AM HEAD | grep '\\.py$' | xargs ruff format
</command>
</format>

## Workflow
1. Follow <read-design-doc> section to understand the feature.
2. Follow <research> section to understand the current project.
3. Follow <plan> section to create plan.md for the feature development.
4. Follow <execution> section to complete a task.
5. Repeat the <execution> cycle until all tasks are complete.
6. Follow <format> section to format the modified code.

## Coding Principles
- **Consistency First**: Style Adherence, Naming Alignment, Structural Harmony and Pattern Continuity
- **Context Awareness**: Dependency Management, Error Handling, Documentation, Testing
- **Integration Seamlessness**: Module Boundaries, API Consistency, Configuration Alignment
- **Code Reuse:** Prioritize reusing existing internal modules and stable third-party libraries; avoid reinventing solutions.
- **Google Style Guides:** Strictly follow [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).
- **Best Practices:** Emphasize maintainability, readability, modularity, and robustness in your code.
- **Testing:** Write appropriate unit and integration tests alongside feature implementation.

## Communication

- If any requirement or dependency is unclear, actively ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
- Provide concise progress summaries after each completed task.
